# Ethyca Systems Map

A prototype that renders a systems map from a JSON dataset, with filters, selection, and dependency navigation.

**Summary**
- Filters are multi-select and the layout grouping stays stable.
- Selecting a system highlights its direct dependencies.
- Dependency panel provides scroll-to navigation.
- UI uses React + TypeScript + Vite, CSS Modules, and MUI controls.
- On smaller screens the top bar collapses into toggle buttons.

**Scripts**
1. `npm run dev` – Start the dev server
2. `npm run build` – Type-check and build
3. `npm run typecheck` – Type-check only
4. `npm run preview` – Preview the production build
5. `npm run lint` – Lint
6. `npm test` – Unit tests (Vitest)
7. `npm run test:e2e` – Playwright tests

**Technologies**
- React 19 (new compiler) + TypeScript
- Vite
- Zustand
- Material UI
- CSS Modules
- Vitest + Testing Library
- Playwright

**Design Choices**
- `useSystemsData` fetches `sample_data.json`; tests mock fetch or import directly from the data folder.
- Layout groups are derived from the full dataset, so filtering doesn’t reorder columns.
- Dependency navigation links scroll to specific cards; if the page doesn’t overflow, those links have no effect.
- CSS Modules keep styles scoped and easier to manage.
- Zustand centralizes selection/dependency state across components.

**Possible Improvements**
1. Loading/error UI for data fetch
2. Add search
3. Accessibility
4. Virtualization for large datasets
5. Persist filters in the URL
6. Theming
7. Chnage folder structure as the app grows. Distribute files per route or feature
8. Add another scroll-navigation panel for filtered items
9. Use scss
